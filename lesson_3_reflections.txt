When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working with other people to share the project
Can access it from different places
Additional backup is also nice

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

When several people work on same project, you might not want to add changes made
by other people to your repository. Or same files can be changed in different ways
and you have to first decide which changes to keep.
You control when you are comfortable sharing your work by updating GitHub
only when you are ready.
