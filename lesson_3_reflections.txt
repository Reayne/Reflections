When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working with other people to share the project
Can access it from different places
Additional backup is also nice

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

When several people work on same project, you might not want to add changes made
by other people to your repository. Or same files can be changed in different ways
and you have to first decide which changes to keep.
You control when you are comfortable sharing your work by updating GitHub
only when you are ready.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Branches are different versions of a repository
Clones are the same repository stored in different places
Forks are similar to branches but use GitHub

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

When you want to review changes made remotely from your own computer
and compare them to your local changes
