What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You initialize a repository when you want to start tracking changes in it.
Git creates a hidden folder (.git) inside a repository.
This folder will contain all commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area explicitly shows what changes you want to be included in a commit.
Repository contains ALL files.
Working directory contains files within git.
